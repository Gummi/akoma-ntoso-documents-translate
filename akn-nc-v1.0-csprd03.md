The present specification defines the naming convention that needs to be implemented in order to conform to the second level of compliance with the Akoma Ntoso schema.

In this specification, when MUST is used in the text, it MUST be understood as “in order to conform to level 2 of compliance with the Akoma Ntoso schema” (see section 6).

## <a name="_Toc480804256"></a><a name="_Toc409028133">2.1 The Importance of Text Identification in Legislation</a>

In HTML, the primary link type is _anchor-to-document_, while _anchor-to-anchor_ links are a minor addition for uncharacteristic cases. For this reason identifiers are never required: authors are expected to provide identifiers only for those structures that are likely destinations of anchor-to-anchor links – often just a few section headings.

In legislation, on the other hand, ALL references are to a precise substructure of a highly hierarchical document flow, and any substructure may become a destination. This is the reason why identifiers are useful for most structures of a legislative document.

Additionally, in HTML the reference is usually meant for navigation by human users. It is only necessary to come close enough to the intended destination that a human eye can scan the surrounding text or elements and find the exact destination in the vicinity.

In legislation, there is an additional type of reference, “modification”. Modifications require that a specific substructure be precisely identified and modified by a modification instruction. In this case, one cannot be satisfied with the fact that the intended destination is somewhat near the arrived destination -- they must coincide.

By using the layering provided by the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) (See Section 4.1), Akoma Ntoso strongly differentiates between the legislative context and the markup used to represent it. References are legislative concepts, and exist regardless of whether they exist in the markup. The same content, for instance, could be represented in a number of different XML files created by various authors. They would all be distinct manifestations of the same Expression, each of which may have the same body, but different markup choices, metadata, commentary, etc. References would need to work regardless of the specific Manifestation chosen as the destination, and, indeed, it is important that all manifestations use the same identifiers for the same structures, standardized by the LegalDocML Technical Committee. This is affected by the fact that an author may not even have the document of the destination, or that it may not even exist yet (time-based alchemies frequently occur in legislation, one might need to create links to documents that have yet to be converted into Akoma Ntoso, etc.). Thus, providing a forced and precise syntax for identifiers is the best guarantee that all different manifestations of the same content have the same identifiers and that one does not need to read an XML file to divine the values of its identifiers.

Legal references have peculiar traits regarding time. For instance, in the case of an evolving document (e.g., a piece of legislation receiving references and being actively modified by the legislator), the actual destination of the reference is neither the original version, nor the current version, but in many cases the version of the document that was valid at the moment in time when the case took place. References are dynamic rather than static, because the destination moves in time and jurisdiction according to the needs rather than being fixed to a specific sentence or fragment. This means that point-in-time consolidation is an important affair, and that determining the destination of a dynamic link requires, at the very least, that structures existing in multiple versions are named consistently. For example, it must be clear that, if section 35 of the initial version of a title of a U.S. code had some identifier _y_, then ALL subsequent versions of that same section 35 (even after a renumbering action) have the same identifier _y_, so that once you determine the needed version, arriving at the right structure is easy and straightforward.

The syntax of identifiers is defined to ensure that identifiers can be used regardless of the versions of the same document, regardless of the author of individual XML markups, regardless of usage of navigational or modification references, and knowing full well that point-to-point references are the norm rather than the exception.

The Akoma Ntoso naming convention does not assume that the document is stored in Akoma Ntoso XML, but only that there is a mapping between the FRBR IRI reference and the URL of a file stored somewhere on the Internet, and to which our reference can be resolved into.

In the case of identifiers, the Akoma Ntoso naming convention does not assume, yet again, that the document is stored in Akoma Ntoso XML, but only that identifiers work in whatever format has been used. This means that any XML-based language, including Akoma Ntoso, HTML, TEI, DocBook, ePub, kf8, or Mobi are acceptable and can make use of the Naming Convention presented here.

The Akoma Ntoso Naming convention also assumes that it is the job of the author of the linked-to document to use identifiers that are consistent with the naming convention. This is necessary because, in HTTP, the fragment identifier is never sent with the request and is only known and handled by the user agent, so we must assume that identifiers are present in the response and have the correct form. In particular, it would make no sense to convert all fragment identifiers in references using the syntax of the destination documents, as these syntaxes can be quite innumerable.

Identifiers are the main way Akoma Ntoso identifies fragments and parts of the document in an unambiguous form. They can be used in document references (e.g., links and amendment commands) as a precise pointer to the actual part of the document mentioned (as opposed to simply referring to a document as a whole).

Identifiers are systematically used in Akoma Ntoso. All Akoma Ntoso elements allow up to three identifiers. Even internal links need to use identifiers. Most relevant elements and sections require at least one identifier.



# <a name="_Toc480804257"></a><a name="_Toc409028134">3      Scope</a>



The Akoma Ntoso naming convention identifies, in a unique way, all Akoma Ntoso concepts and resources on the Internet and, in general, all collections thereof. These principles and characteristics should be respected in the naming convention:

1.     **_MEANINGFULNESS_**: the name is a meaningful and logical description of the resource and not of its physical path.

2.     **_PERMANENCE_**: the name must be permanent and stable over time.

3.     **_INVARIANCE_**: the name must derive from invariant properties of the resource so as to provide some degree of certainty in obtaining the same name for the same resource regardless of process, tool and person.

FRBR concepts are used differently when referring to documents in a variety of situations. In each case it is important to use the IRI for the correct FRBR level of document. Here, we describe a few particularly frequent situations:

1.             Legislative references will most probably refer to Works --: acts referring to other acts do so regardless of the actual version, and references must be to something independent of all possible expressions, e.g., to the Work.

2.             The list of attachments and schedules belong to a specific Expression, so references to ExpressionComponents are specific to the Expression-level.

3.             The specific Manifestation that is the Akoma Ntoso XML format uses an XML-based syntax to refer to ExpressionComponents, and associate them to the corresponding ManifestationComponents containing the appropriate content. Therefore, within XML files the IRI of the ManifestationComponents must be used to refer to all components including the main document, all attachments, and all schedules.

4.object> and <span style="font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;"><img> elements with the appropriate ManifestationComponent IRI. Even if the same multimedia content appears in different parts of the content of a Manifestation, each instance of that content must correspond to a different ManifestationComponent, and must be considered independently of the other.

5.             It is an Item-level decision, once ascertained that the content is exactly identical, to provide space-saving policies by storing only one copy of the multimedia content. This Item-level decision has no impact on references and names, which are still individually different from each other.

6.             Non-document concepts are referred to within the metadata and content of Akoma Ntoso documents. References are always performed in two steps: the first step ties the reference point in the document to an item in the References section using internal (and not standardized) identifiers; the second step ties the item in the reference section to the actual concept through the IRI of the concept as specified in this Naming Convention.

Since the most primary concepts in Akoma Ntoso are connected to documents, the main part of this section is devoted to detailing the IRIs of document-related concepts, and in particular Works, Expressions, and Manifestations. Items are, by definition, outside of the scope of this standard and are only briefly described. The final part of the section provides an IRI-based naming mechanism for non-document entities (as well as for document entities when they are handled in a similar way to non-document entities).

## <a name="_Toc480804259"></a><a name="_Toc409028137">4.1 Introduction to compliant IRI syntaxes</a>

The Akoma Ntoso standard defines a number of referenceable concepts that are used in many situations in the lifecycle of legal documents.

The purpose of this section is to provide:

a) a standard referencing mechanism to these concepts through the use of IRI references associated to classes and instances of an ad hoc ontology (the Akoma Notoso Naming Convention). The referencing mechanism discussed in this document is meant to be generic and evolving with the evolution of the underlying ontology;

b) a set of requirements for other naming conventions to be usable within Akoma Ntoso XML resources in a proper way (Functionally Equivalent Naming Conventions see 4.12).

## <a name="_Toc480804260">4.2 Document IRIs</a>

The most important concepts of the Akoma Ntoso informal ontology are related to documents that have legal status. All discourses and all descriptions of legal sources can be characterized as referring to one of the four levels of a document as introduced by IFLA FRBR (]):

(a)   Work – the abstract concept of the legal resource (e.g., act 3 of 2015).

(b)   Expression - any version of the Work whose content is specified and different from others for any reason: language, versions, etc. (e.g., act 3 of 2015 as in the version following the amendments entered into force on July 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2016).

(c)   Manifestation - any electronic or physical format of the Expression: MS Word, Open Office, XML, TIFF, PDF, etc. (e.g., PDF representation of act 3 of 2015 as in the version following the amendments entered into force on July 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2016).

(d)   Item – the physical copy of any Manifestation in the form of a file stored somewhere in some computer on the network or disconnected (e.g., the file called act32015.pdf  on my computer containing a PDF representation of act 3, 2015 as in the version following the amendments entered into force on July 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2016).

All documents at all levels can be composed of sub-elements that, when combined, form the whole document. These are called components and abstractly represent the notion that several independent _subdocuments_ form the whole document as it appears to the reader (i.e., a main body possibly followed by a number of attachments such as schedules and tables):

         WorkComponents (e.g., main, schedule, annexes, table) - the WorkComponents are abstract entities that can be referenced to refer to different ExpressionComponents in time.

         ExpressionComponent (e.g., main, schedule, annexes, or table.) - the ExpressionComponents represent the visible division of the document as generated by the content author (Parliament, etc.) for a specific Expression of the Work.

         ManifestationComponent (e.g., xml files, PDF files, or TIFF images.) - the ManifestationComponents represent the division of the document as generated by the Manifestation author (e.g., the XML editor) for a specific Manifestation of a specific Expression.

         ItemComponent - the actual files corresponding to the ManifestationComponents

Other concepts dealt by the Akoma Ntoso informal ontology also derive from the IFLA FRBR ontology, and include, but are not limited to, individuals (Person), organizations (Corporate Body), actions and occurrences (Event), locations (Place), ideas (Concept) and physical objects (Object).

## <a name="_Toc480804261"></a><a name="_Toc409028138">4.3 Absolute and Relative IRIs</a>

At all levels, the Akoma Ntoso IRIs belong to the http:// scheme and are normally resolved using mechanisms widely available in browsers and web servers. Within documents, IRIs are used as references to addressable resources, and are thus called _IRI references_.

According to the authoritative source RFC 3986[[2]](#_ftn2), all http:// IRI references are divided into _absolute IRI_ and _relative IRI references_. An absolute IRI starts with the string “http://”, which is then followed by an officially registered domain name, and the local part that starts off the first individual “/” character. A relative reference, on the other hand, has no indication of the scheme, no indication of the domain name, and may have further missing parts at the beginning of the whole string (no missing parts on the end, though). Browsers are able to build the absolute IRI corresponding to the relative IRI by adding at the beginning of the provided IRI the missing parts that are taken from the IRI of a base resource. 

In XML manifestations of Akoma Ntoso documents, IRI references are always expressed in relative forms.

This implies that any resolution is carried out by the source of the base document (e.g., the one where the IRI reference is stored). This makes all IRIs independent of the actual resolution mechanism, and allows for very flexible storage, access, and reference mechanisms. This means that all resolution mechanisms used to access an Akoma Ntoso document from another Akoma Ntoso document will rely on the same resolution mechanism as the original one, regardless of the resolution mechanism employed to generate the documents themselves. In case the hosting document lacks a base IRI, it is the responsibility of the active application to provide a base IRI in its stead.

Since it is a requirement of Akoma Ntoso that all existing FRBR items of a Manifestation are byte-per-byte identical to each other, it is a natural consequence that it is not abstractly relevant which resolution engine dereferences the actual Item whose IRI is resolved out of a Work-level, an Expression-level, or a Manifestation-level IRI reference. This, in practice, means that protocol and authority are not contributing information to the resolution, and are thus interchangeable. Parties interested in absolute IRIs for Akoma Ntoso are required to produce their own resolution engine and use its protocol and authority for the purpose.

Another distinction is between _global_ and _local_ IRI references[<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">[3]](#_ftn3). A global IRI reference is a relative IRI reference where all parts are present except for protocol and authority (i.e., domain name). Thus, a global IRI reference _always_ starts with a slash, to indicate that _all_ other parts are explicitly specified. A local IRI reference, on the other hand, may have one or more parts missing (necessarily from left to right), and the corresponding global (and, subsequently, absolute) IRI reference is determined by adding the corresponding parts taken from the base document, as usual with relative IRI references with missing parts. In the following we will call all IRI references as simply IRI (they are _all_ references, after all), and distinguish between absolute IRIs, global IRIs and local IRIs.

In XML manifestations of Akoma Ntoso documents, all Work, Expression, and Manifestation-level references to whole documents must be _global_, and all references to individual components within the same level (or lower levels) must be _local_ and are stored simply as the name of the corresponding component.

Thus, for instance, "/akn/kn/act/2015-01-01/1/!schedule_1" is the relative, global Work-level IRI for schedule 1 of act 1/2007 of Kenya. However, a Work-level reference to schedule 1 placed within the main document of the act will only contain the local IRI "1/!schedule1". This guarantees that these references continue to work even after new expressions are created of the same Work, either if the part containing the reference is changed or if it remains untouched.

Akoma Ntoso XML elements refer to other documents according to different levels of the FRBR hierarchy. In particular, <attachment> always refer to components of the host document, and thus always use local references.

In the Akoma Ntoso Naming Convention, a reference to a different document is always global:

<div style="border-top:solid windowtext 1.0pt;border-left:none;border-bottom:
solid windowtext 1.0pt;border-right:none;padding:3.0pt 0in 3.0pt 0in;
background:#D9D9D9;margin-left:.3in;margin-right:.3in">

>



This means that whenever referring to a different document it is necessary to provide the full list of identification parts even when they are identical to the ones of the base document. On the other hand, local IRI references are used in the Akoma Ntoso naming convention for references to components or fragments, and implicitly make use of the identification parts of the base document for the correct resolution of the IRI reference. 

Global IRI references are discussed in sections 4.4 through 4.8, while local IRI references are discussed in section 4.9.

## <a name="_Toc480804262"></a><a name="_Toc409028140"></a><a name="_Toc409028050"></a><a name="_Toc409028139"></a>4.4 Resolving Akoma Ntoso IRI references

The Akoma Ntoso naming architecture is built so as not to rely on the existence of a single storage architecture, since the IRIs stored within documents are differentiated from the ones physically representing the resource being sought.

The mapping from architecture-independent IRIs into accessible architecture-dependent URLs (representing the best Item for the document being sought) is realized through specific applications called _IRI resolvers_. The Akoma Ntoso naming architecture is built so as not to rely on the existence of any individual IRI resolver, but assumes that all IRIs are always correctly resolved to the best available Item regardless of the resolving mechanisms. In fact, each naming authority is given the global task of resolving any possible Akoma Ntoso IRIs, regardless of whether it belongs or not to the country or countries managed by the naming authority. This implies that the authority-specific details of IRIs are purposefully omitted in this specification, and need to be considered only when first accessing a document.

For this reason, all IRIs in this specification are prefixed with the arbitrary domain name _<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;
color:#333333">[http://www.authority.org]_ that stands for any of an arbitrarily large number of equivalent naming authorities.

The IRI reference for the Work is the baseline for building the IRI reference for the Expression (section 4.5), which is the baseline for the IRI reference of the Manifestation (section 4.6). Additionally, all IRI references can be enriched with information about the component and the fragment requested (section 4.8). IRI references for items are beyond the scope of this Naming Convention.

The IRI for the Work consists of the following pieces, separated by forward slashes “/”:

         The base URL of a naming authority with IRI-resolving capabilities _(not relevant for the Naming Convention)_. In all our examples this will always be described as _<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:

         A detail fragment that organizes additional data in a hierarchical fashion:

–/akn</tt> prefix to allow the identification of the IRI as belonging to the Akoma Ntoso Naming Convention (required)

–<FRBRcountry> in the metadata. (required)

–      Type of document. For an Akoma Ntoso XML representation, this value MUST correspond to the element immediately below the akomaNtoso root element (e.g., act, bill, or debateReport.) (required)

–<FRBRsubtype> in the metadata or, in its absence, to the “name” attribute of the document type (optional).

–<FRBRWork> section of the metadata (optional).

–<FRBRWork> section of the metadata (required).

## <a name="_Toc480804264"></a><a name="_Toc409028147">4.6 The IRI</a> reference of an Expression

Characterizing the Expression is the specific identification of the features of the content. This includes specifications of the version and the language of the Expression. Therefore, different versions of the same Work, or the same version of the same Work expressed in different languages correspond to different Expressions and will have different IRIs. Expressions are organized in components (the ExpressionComponents), and therefore we need to identify separately the Expression as a whole from the individual IRIs for each ExpressionComponent. All of them are all immediately derived from the baseline, which is the IRI for the Work.

### <a name="_Toc480804265"></a><a name="_Toc409028148">4.6.1 The IRI for the Expression as a Whole</a>

The IRI for the Expression as a whole consists of the following pieces:

         The IRI of the corresponding Work as discussed in section 4.4

         The character “/”

FRBRlanguage> in the metadata section. According with ISO 639-2 alpha-3 “mul” means multilingual document (text with different languages), while “und” means undetermined language

         The “@” character (required)

         Zero or more semicolon-separated version identifiers as follows:

<span style="font-family:&quot;Century Gothic&quot;,sans-serif;
color:black">-in the <span style="font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
color:black"><).

<FRBRversionNumber>

         Any content-specification date (as opposed to validity dates) (optional).

section of the metadata.

The absence of the version identifiers signals two different situations depending on the type of document:

       If the document is not versioned (e.g., the debate record of an assembly) then version identifier need not and cannot be present.

       If the document is versioned (e.g., an act in force), then the lack of version identifiers refers to the version in force at the moment of the resolution of the IRI (i.e., the “current” version of the act, where “current” refers to the moment in time in which the IRI is dereferenced, rather than the moment in time in which the document containing the IRI was created: _today_ for the reader, as opposed to _today_ for the author of the references).

A particular Expression is the first version of a Work. This Expression should not be confused with the Work itself (which considers the first Expression in no special way to all other possible expressions), and it is a very specific, although peculiar, Expression. The first version of an Expression is referred to with an IRI with a dangling "@" character (which implies that the actual version date is the first appropriate date for that Work).

### <a name="_Toc480804266"></a><a name="_Toc409028153">4.6.2 The IRIs for Virtual Expressions</a>

In some situations, the information such as the actual enter-in-force date or the language of an Expression is not known in advance, or it is necessary to create references or mentions of documents whose features are now known completely (possibly, because their exact delivery date is not known yet). These are called _virtual expressions_ (i.e., references to expressions that probably do not exist yet or ever, but can be unambiguously deduced once all relevant information is made available.)

There are at least three cases where such a situation may arise:

1.     The information is not known by the author of the reference (e.g., the legislator), in which case the act of actually retrieving the correct information is in itself an act of interpretation.

2.     The information is not known by the editor of the text containing the reference (e.g., the publisher of the XML version of the document), in which case the information can theoretically be available, but is too much of a burden for the publisher to retrieve it.

3.     The information is not known by the query system when evaluating the reference.

In these cases, the syntax for the IRI of the virtual Expression uses a similar syntax to the specification of the actual Expression, but the character “:” is used before each unknown value and instead of the “@” at the end of the specification of the Work-level IRI. For instance, if we need to reference the Expression of an act in force on date “1/1/2007”, we will probably need to refer to some Expression whose enter in force date was in a previous date to 1/1/2007.

## <a name="_Toc480804268">4.8 Specifying components and portions</a>

Referring to within-documents destination is possible by adding to a whole-document reference an additional item pointing to the specific destination. Within this specification we distinguish between _components_ and _portions_.  

Some documents are made of many components; some are only composed of a main document. Within each component, structured portions can be localized and referred to by means of identifying information. Legal citations often point to a specific portions of the abstract document, as in “Article 3 of Directive 2003/87/EC”.

In order to explicitly refer to individual components and portions, it is therefore necessary to introduce a naming convention that identifies them, and allows an easy connection between the component and the document it belongs to.

Components and portions are a way to organize content. As such, they are naturally Expression-level concepts, which is where content is actually expressed and structured. Yet, it is sometimes appropriate to refer to components and portions in Work-level references, and therefore a syntax for these situations is provided. For instance, consider an original act that refers to table A of schedule 1\. After a little time, schedule 1 is completely abrogated and table A thus becomes (implicitly) an attachment of the main document. As such, it is important that all references to table A of schedule 1 are considered as references to table A of the main document after that event. This brings about the necessity to have IRIs for Work Components. These are to be used when referring in a Work-level style to components that have official names and positions, but may change in name and position with time.

Components and portions are specified at the end of the IRI for Work-level and Expression-level references, and just before the data format for Manifestation-level references. They are introduced by a special character to separate the parts of the IRI reference identifying the document as a whole from the parts identifying the component and/or portion.

### <a name="_Toc480804269">4.8.1 Specifying components in IRI references</a>

A Work-level IRI reference including a component specification consists of the following pieces: 

       The IRI of the corresponding Work as a whole

       The character “/”

       The character “!” and

       Either:

–      The name “main” if the component is the only component or the main component in a hierarchy

–      A unique name for the attachment, optionally followed by the number associated to this component in the document.  If this number is provided, it is separated from the name with “_”.

For instance:

–[http://www.authority.org]_**/akn/kn/act/2007-01-01/1/!main**  
Kenya, main document  of act 1, 2007

An Expression-level IRI reference including a component specification consists of the following pieces: 

       The IRI of the corresponding Expression as a whole

       The character “/”

       The character “!” and

       Either:

–      The name “main” if the component is the only component or the main component in a hierarchy

–      A unique name for the attachment, optionally followed by the number associated to this component in the document.  If this number is provided, it is separated from the name with “_”.

       The IRI of the corresponding Manifestation as a whole, minus the “.” and the specification of the format,

### <a name="_Toc480804270">4.8.2 Hierarchies of components in component specifications</a>

A frequent situation occurs when an attachment has itself further attachments. This creates a complex hierarchical situation in which the component should be considered, in a way, as a document by itself, composed of components which need to be listed and properly differentiated. The process is further iterated whenever its attachments also have further attachments and so on. The situation must also foresee the situation in which attachments at different levels of the hierarchy end up having the same name (e.g., table A in schedule 1 and table A in schedule 2).

In such situations, each component must be considered as a document by itself. Recursively, the specification of components in IRI references are as follows:

       If the component does not have attachments, its IRI reference is determined as detailed in the previous sections, without further additions.

       If the component has attachments, the IRI  reference detailed in the previous sections is meant to refer to the component as a whole, including its attachments.

       To refer to the main document of a component that has further attachments, an additional “/main” part is specified.

       To refer to any further attachment of component, a further “/” followed by a unique name for the attachment is added.

### <a name="_Toc480804271">4.8.3  _Components in the Akoma Ntoso Package Manifestation

The Akoma Ntoso package Manifestation is a very specific Manifestation using a number of data formats (mainly XML but other multimedia formats could be present as needed) with a very specific organization of parts and components. Since it makes explicit choices in terms of data formats and reciprocal references, it is important to provide clear and non-ambiguous rules as to the internal naming mechanism and its overall structure. An Akoma Ntoso package manifestation is a package composed of one or more files organized in a flat fashion. The transportable format is a ZIP file whose extension is “.akn”. Other formats are possible and acceptable as long as they adhere to these rules.

The following are alternative options for the Akoma Ntoso package:

1.     If the document is just composed of text and does not refer to any multimedia fragment of any form, then the ZIP package contains a single document called “main.xml”.

2.     If the document is composed of many Manifestation-level components but does not refer to any multimedia fragment of any form, then the zip package is composed of many XML files, **one for each Expression-level component**. Each Manifestation-level component is then called as its corresponding Expression-level component, plus the “.xml” extension. The name “main” is reserved for the main component. Numbers are never used except when they are already part of the Expression-level component’s name. 

3.img> elements. All multimedia components MUST be stored within an inner structure (e.g., a folder) called “media”. Multimedia components can be called freely, but MUST use the appropriate extension to refer to their content type. Thus a logo can be called “logo.tif” or any other name, as long as the extension is correctly specifying the content type.

Reciprocal references to Manifestation-level components are necessary within a specific Manifestation. For instance, the Manifestation of the main document refers to the manifestations of its attachments via the <attachment> elements, and the schedule showing an image refers to the file of the image via the img> element. In these cases, all references MUST be relative to the package (i.e., the Manifestation as a whole):

-attachment1.xml  
Manifestation of the first attachment of the current document

-schedule3.xml  
Manifestation of the third attachment of the current document

media/logo.tif  
Manifestation of an image within the current document

### <a name="_Toc480804272">4.8.4 Specifying portions</a>

A portion is a specific document type in Akoma Ntoso XML, that contains a only a part of a whole document. Portion documents are used when the full document is large, and only a smaller part is necessary, such as a few sections or articles.

Requesting a portion is therefore only appropriate for Akoma Ntoso XML Manifestations, and is not guaranteed to be supported by all servers. A request for a portion therefore MUST return a manifestations containing at least the requested part, but possibly containing much more than the requested part, up to and including the whole document the part belongs to. 

In an Akoma Ntoso IRI reference, the specification for the portion of a document is introduced by the special character “~”.

Therefore, a Work-level IRI reference (or an Expression-level IRI reference) including a portion specification consists of the following pieces: 

       The IRI of the corresponding Work (or, respectively, of the corresponding Expression) as a whole,

       The character “/” (required),

       A specification of the component according to section 4.7.1 (optional),

       The character “~” (required),

       Either:

–      The eId of the element containing the subtree being requested, or 

–      A pair of eIds of the first and last elements of the sequence of parts being requested, separated by a dash “->“.

In order to allow the specification of the data format of a Manifestation to be the last item of the IRI as usual in web addresses, Manifestation-level IRI references are built differently than Work-level and Expression-level IRI references.

In fact, a Manifestation-level IRI reference including a portion specification consists of the following pieces: 

       The IRI of the corresponding Manifestation as a whole, minus the “.” and the specification of the format,

       The character “/” (required),

       A specification of the component according to section 4.7.1 (optional),

       The character “~” (required),

       Either:

–      The eId of the element containing the subtree being requested, or 

–      A pair of eIds of the first and last elements of the sequence of parts being requested, separated by a dash “->“.

       The character “.” (required)

FRBRManifestation> section of the metadata.

For instance:

~art_3  
The portion containing article 3 of the Work of the European Directive 2003/87/EC

~art_3  
The portion containing article 3 of the Expression of the European Directive 2003/87/EC in English

~art_3  
->art_5  
The portion containing article 3 to article 5 of the Expression of the European Directive 2003/87/EC in English at the version dated 2015-01-20

~art_3.xml  
The portion containing article 3 of schedule 1 of the XML Manifestation of the European Directive 2003/87/EC in English at the version dated 2015-01-20.

When the component is the main component of the document, the “!main” part can be omitted.  So the following IRIs are equivalent to the previous examples:

~art_3

~art_3

~art_3->art_5

~art_3.xml

## <a name="_Toc480804273"></a><a name="_Toc409028160">4.9 The IRI of an Item</a>

Akoma Ntoso makes no assumption about the physical storage mechanism employed to record actual manifestations. As such, there is NO rule for IRIs of the items, which are free to assume any form whatsoever and correspond to whatever storage mechanism has been employed locally.

On the other hand, the actual URL for the Item must be provided to a resolution mechanism in order for the hyper-textual feature of the Akoma Ntoso publication systems to work correctly and automatically.

## <a name="_Toc409028161"></a><a name="_Toc480804274">4.10 Local IRI references</a>

A global IRI reference is a relative IRI reference where all parts are present except for protocol and authority (i.e., domain name). A global IRI reference _always_ starts with a slash, to indicate that _all_ other parts are explicitly specified. A local IRI reference, on the other hand, has one or more parts missing (necessarily from left to right), and the corresponding global (and, subsequently, absolute) IRI reference is determined by adding the corresponding parts taken from the base document, as described in RFC 3986\.

In the Akoma Ntoso Naming Convention, a reference to a different document is always global. Local IRI references are used for references to components, portions or fragments, and implicitly make use of the identification parts of the base document for the correct resolution of the IRI reference. 

There are three types of local IRI references in this specification:

### <a name="_Toc480804275">4.10.1 Fragment references</a>

A fragment reference is composed of just the fragment part of the Akoma Ntoso IRI reference, according to the specification of RFC 3986. It is composed of the following parts:

       The character “#” (required)

       The eId of the element requested

For instance:

         #art_5

As per RFC 3986, dereferencing this IRI reference does not imply making a request to the origin server. This request scrolls the current document so as to bring into view the part of the document whose eId has been requested.

The implication of using this type of local references is that the requested part of the document is already dereferenced and available at the client. On the other hand, any Akoma Ntoso document can contain this type of references.

### <a name="_Toc480804276">4.10.2 Local component references</a>

A local component reference is composed of just the component part of the Akoma Ntoso IRI reference, according to the syntax in section 4.7.1\. It is composed of the following parts:

       The character “!” and

       Either:

    The name “main” if the component is the only component or the main component in a hierarchy

    A unique name for the attachment, optionally followed by the number associated to this component in the document.  If this number is provided, it is separated from the name with “_”.

For instance:

         !schedule_3

         !main

Dereferencing this IRI reference implies making a new request to the origin server. The server may choose to return the requested component either as an autonomous document or as a component of a document collection document type.

The implication of using this type of local references is that the base IRI MUST already contain either the component or the portion part. It is unspecified and usually incorrect to use a local component reference in a document whose base IRI does NOT include a component or portion part. 

### <a name="_Toc480804277">4.10.3 Local portion references</a>

A local portion reference is composed of just the portion part of the Akoma Ntoso IRI reference, according to the syntax in section 4.7.4\. It is composed of the following parts:

       The character “~” (required),

       Either:

–      The eId of the element containing the subtree being requested, or 

–      A pair of eIds of the first and last elements of the sequence of parts being requested, separated by a dash “->“.

For instance:

         ~art_5

         ~sec_3->sec_5

Dereferencing this IRI reference implies making a new request to the origin server. The server MUST either return the requested part as a portion document type containing at least the part being requested, OR the full document or component containing the part being requested, even when they correspond to the current document.

The implication of using this type of local references is that the base IRI MUST already contain either the component or the portion part. It is unspecified and usually incorrect to use a local component reference in a document whose base IRI does NOT include a component or portion part. 

### <a name="_Toc480804278">4.10.4 Mixed local references</a>

It s always possible to combine the three different types of local references into a complex local IRI reference. For instance:

         **!main/schedule_1~art_3->art_5#art_4**  
a portion document containing at least the sequence from article 3 to article 5 of the component called schedule 1 of the current document. When dereferenced, scroll to article 4\.

## <a name="_Toc480804279">4.11 The IRI of Non-Document Entities</a>

The object of all discourses within the Akoma Ntoso framework can be described as a set of abstract classes and their instances and of the relationship among them. Cumulatively, definition of classes, relationships and instances are called an _ontology_.

The four most important classes of the Akoma Ntoso informal ontology (Work, Expression, Manifestation, and Item) are surely connected to documents, but many more exist, even if they are not connected directly to physical documents. The purpose of this section is to provide syntax for non-document entities (i.e., instances of non-document classes such as people, organizations, or concepts.) Furthermore, the syntax described here can also be used for document entities as an equivalent syntax to the one specified in the previous sections.

Akoma Ntoso entities are always associated to a class, providing a structure of properties and relationships to other instances of the same and other classes. Classes in the Akoma Ntoso informal ontology are organized in a complex maze of sub/superclasses. These are useful to give shape and meaning to a domain, and to provide structure to the overall set of instances of a base class. It is important to notice that sub/superclasses do not form necessarily a tree, but can form a more complex structure, namely a _directed graph_.

For instance, the class of Kenyan judges can be considered a sub class of both Kenyan persons and of persons whose job description is judge. That is, there is a (implicit or explicit) subclass of Judges and (implicit or explicit) subclasses of Kenyans, both of which are, in turn, subclasses of Person, and Kenyan Judges is a subclass of both. In fact, we immediately derive the principle that every different value in every different property or relationship implicitly generates a class, that turns into an explicit class only because of our whim or need. For instance, the class of all persons named “Joe” exists implicitly, identifies all persons whose first name is “Joe”, and, if so desired, can be made explicit through the definition of a subclass of Person.

While this is very useful for determining relationships between entities, it affects the mechanism to associate IRIs to such entities. In particular, being that there is no single hierarchy of classes, it is not appropriate to propose a single path of specifications from the super class to the final class. As such, ideally /person/ken/judge/JoeSmith.

In order to maintain meaningfulness, permanence and invariance (which are the main requirements for our naming convention, as specified in the introduction of this document) we need to find a reliable naming mechanism for clearly identifying entities that does not depend on the sub/superclass organization except when strictly necessary.

In particular, we define the concept of _Top Level Classes_ (TLC) that are guaranteed to be a partition of the overall domain of the Akoma Ntoso standard. TLC include Work, Expression, Manifestation, Item, Person, Organization, Concept, Object, Event, Process, Role, Term and Location. The list of TLC may, in the future, include more, as long as they keep on generating a partition (i.e., that they are disjoint and cumulatively describe all possible instance of the Akoma Ntoso domain). Members of the TLC classes can be subclassed at will and with no theoretical constraints.

Given the high number of foreseeable subclasses of the TLC, and the pointlessness of determining a fixed hierarchy in such number, the naming of entities should not depend on the presence or absence of a given class except for TLC. This means that it is necessary that each instance of each TLC is provided with an ID string that is guaranteed to be unique within the TLC. The syntax of this ID is dependent of the TLC class, and the syntax for each of the existing TLC is provided in the next section.

Therefore, the IRI for non-document entities consists of the following pieces:

       The base URL of a naming authority with IRI-resolving capabilities

       A detail fragment organizing in a hierarchical fashion the additional data:

–/akn</tt> prefix to allow the identification of the IRI as belonging to the Akoma Ntoso Naming Convention (required)

–      The string “/ontology”

–      The official name of the appropriate TLC

–      Any number (including none) of slash-separated subclasses of the TLC, as long as they all refer to correct properties of the corresponding instance

–      The ID of the instance, guaranteed to be unique within the TLC.

All components are separated by forward slashes (“/”) so as to exploit relative IRIs in references.

Please note that the classes Work, Expression, Manifestation, and Item belong to the ontology as much as the other classes. As such, each Work, Expression, and Manifestation can also be indicated with an ontology-based IRI that refers to exactly the same entity. Therefore, the following IRIs are equivalent pair-wise, and refer to the same entities:

### <a name="_Toc480804280"></a><a name="_Toc409028162">4.11.1 The Identifiers for Top Level Classes</a>

As mentioned in the previous section, the hierarchy of path elements is of no use for identifying instances of each TLC, given the fact that there can be no unique hierarchy of subclasses in the Akoma Ntoso informal ontology. Thus, each instance of the ontology needs to be provided with an ID guaranteed to be unique within the TLC it belongs to. The syntax of the ID depends on the actual TLC, and is briefly explained in the following schema.

#### <a name="_Toc480804281"></a><a name="_Toc409028163">4.11.1.1 TLCPerson</a>

A dot-separated string composed of the country of citizenship, the first name, the family name, the birth date in yyyy-mm-dd format, and an optional arbitrary string if ambiguity exists (e.g., if two individuals with the same name and the same birth date exist in the same country).

–kn.joe.smith.1964-12-22  
Mr. Joe Smith, the only Kenyan citizen with that name born on December 22nd, 1964

#### <a name="_Toc480804282"></a><a name="_Toc409028164">4.11.1.2 TLCOrganization</a>

A dot-separated string composed of the country of registration (or the string “unreg” if not registered anywhere), a recognizable form of the organization name and an optional arbitrary string if ambiguity exists (e.g., if two organizations with the same name exist in the same country).

–kn.parliament  
the Kenyan Parliament

#### <a name="_Toc480804283"></a><a name="_Toc409028165">4.11.1.3 TLCConcept</a>

Concepts differ from terms as they refer to some concept regardless of the linguistic form used. For instance, "pope" and "pontiff" are different linguistic forms for the same concept, while "date" is a single linguistic form potentially referring to two different concepts (a calendar date as opposed to a type of fruit). TLCConcepts must be associated to a specific reference resource that disambiguates it. This must be an item of a thesaurus, of an encyclopedia, or of a commonly available dictionary. The identifier of the TLCConcept is a unique representation of the name of the concept joined with dots and preceded by an unambiguous name for the resource being used. No country specifications are necessary for concepts.

Processes must refer to a specific reference resource that can be used to disambiguate the object being referred to. This must be a thesaurus, an encyclopedia, or a commonly available dictionary. A unique form of the terms specifying the concept joined with dots preceded by an unambiguous name for the resource being used. Country specifications are necessary for processes since processes with the same name may exist with different steps across different countries.

#### <a name="_Toc480804289"></a><a name="_Toc409028171">4.11.1.9 TLCTerm</a>

Terms differ from concepts as they refer to a linguistic form, rather than to the concept expressed by it. Therefore, for instance, "majority vote" and "mayoría de votos" are different linguistic forms in different languages for the same concept.  TLCTerms must be associated to a specific reference resource that disambiguates it. This must be an item of a thesaurus, of an encyclopedia, or of a commonly available dictionary. The identifier of the TLCTerm is a unique representation of the words of the linguistic form joined with dots and preceded by an unambiguous name for the resource being used. No country specifications are necessary for terms, but a language reference is necessary for the correct attribution.

## <a name="_Toc480804291">4.12 Functionally Equivalent Naming Conventions (FENC)</a>

A functionally equivalent naming convention (FENC) is defined as follows:

1\. **recognizable**: a syntactical means exists to recognize the specific syntax used for the URI (e.g., a specific prefix);

2\. **published**: a sufficiently detailed description of the syntax is publicly available and backed by a recognizable institution;

3\. **FRBR compliant**: A full distinction between "distinct intellectual creations", "specific intellectual forms", "physical embodiments" and "exemplars" of relevant documents must be explicitly supported and aligned with the FRBR conceptualizations. Support for items is not necessary nor requested.

4\. **active**: at least one working, available, robust dereferencing mechanism (e.g., a URI resolver, a URI redirector or the standard URI resolution mechanism in HTTP) that provides for dereferencing of URIs/IRIs according to the specific syntax;

5\. **equivalent**: at least one working, accessible, available, robust mechanism must exist that converts URIs/IRIs according to the specific syntax into equivalent URIs/IRIs according to the Akoma Ntoso Naming convention;

6\. **evident**: Akoma Ntoso XML documents identifying themselves (in <FRBRUri> and <FRBRThis> elements) using a FENC URI must also:  
a. EITHER provide <FRBRalias> elements equivalent to the <FRBRThis> element, with URI references that use the Akoma Ntoso Naming Convention, one for each of the first three FRBR levels,  
b. OR treat as REQUIRED instead of optional the following elements (in their respective FRBRWork, FRBRExpression and FRBRManifestation containers):  
  * FRBRdate, FRBRauthor, FRBRcountry, FRBRsubtype, and FRBRformat (always required);  
  * FRBRnumber or FRBRname (at least one MUST be present);  
  * FRBRversionNumber (REQUIRED if the FRBRdate in the Expression level does not exist);  
  * FRBRportion (REQUIRED if the the document is split into portions).Any Naming Convention that complies with these requirements (items 1\. through 6.) is termed a functionally-equivalent Naming Convention (FENC) and its URIs/IRIs can be used in any context where Akoma Ntoso URIs/IRIs are appropriate.

## <a name="_Toc480804293">5.1 Introduction to fragment specifications</a>

Many references need to point to items smaller than whole documents. In sections 4.7, 4.9 and 4.10 the syntax is provided to create IRI references to subdocument units, such as fragments, components and portions.

The description of these syntaxes include the specification for the name or for the identifier of the component or portion being referred to. In this section we discuss how the name and the identifier of these parts should be created and managed, in case the Manifestation being referred to uses the Akoma Ntoso XML vocabulary.

The Akoma Ntoso XML vocabulary uses three different attributes for the attribution of ids to elements. All of them are optional for basic conformance, and required for higher level conformance. For one of these attributes, wIds is not required for conformance level 1, in conformance level 2 they MUST use the syntax described here IF used.

Non XML-based manifestations that use identifiers SHOULD adopt values for ids that are consistent with that specified in this section.

## <a name="_Toc480804294"></a><a name="_Toc409028196">Fundamental principles identifiers in Akoma Ntoso</a>

The Akoma Ntoso Naming Convention identifies, in a unique way, all Akoma Ntoso concepts and resources on the Internet and, in general, all collections thereof. These principles and characteristics should be respected in the use of identifiers for such documents:

       _Universality_: this specification applies to all document types that Akoma Ntoso deals with now or will deal with in the future. It works for amendable parts as well as non-amendable parts, for frequently modified parts as well as never modified parts. It works for original versions, single versions, multiple versions, and chains of versions.

       _Proportionality of impact_: the approach taken for a rare occurrence does not affect the solutions taken for the more frequent occurrences. It is better for the solution of a rare occurrence to be very convoluted than for the solution to a frequent occurrence to be even only mildly convoluted. 

       _Uniqueness_: the identifier of a part is unique within the document.

       _Persistency_: the identifier of a part is persistent across versions, i.e., across all expressions of the same work. The persistency refers to the identity of the part, and not of the name or the number (i.e., if a part is moved and renamed the identifier accompanies the part, and does not stay with the number), so that it is possible to track the movement of the part across versions.

       _Navigability_: the identifier of a part is usable in an IRI reference as the fragment part (after the # character) or as the portion part (after the ~ character), even in hypertext links to a separate document, and the link remains traversable to the right place regardless of what happened to the destination document.

       _Self-sufficiency_: the identifier of a part is the only information needed to perform the basic operations (in particular, navigation and tracking). Explanatory metadata are always optional so that it is not necessary to deal with tracking in a separate metadata section.

<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">[4]](#_ftn4).

       _Meaningfulness_: the identifier of a part expresses, as much as possible, basic facts about its nature, position, or relation to superior and/or neighboring elements that are meaningful to the local tradition.

## <a name="_Toc480804295"></a><a name="_Toc409028197">5.3 Id attributes in the Akoma Ntoso</a> XML vocabulary

There are three different attributes in Akoma Ntoso XML to identify content:

eId **attribute**  (“E_xpression-level” identifier)_  
This is the first and most important identifier. An <span style="font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;">eId attribute provides uniqueness of an element within a specific Expression.  The value of eId is specified as connected to the structural role of the corresponding element.  So, it needs to be updated regularly whenever the structural role of the element changes in a new Expression (i.e., if the element is renumbered or changed in nature, e.g., from article to clause).

wId **attribute** (“_Work-level_” identifier)  
This attribute is only needed if the wId attribute of all other Expressions.

GUID **attribute** (_Globally Unique Identifiers_)  
This attribute is an application-specific identifier that a local implementation may need to add to elements according to local rules and syntaxes. GUID is not a required attribute. Its use and specification is totally dependent on the representation and storage requirements of the author of the Manifestation. Despite the name, GUID do not even have to be globally unique across documents of the same collection. They are meant as a way to place ids from legacy formats and collections and that are still in use. The usage of <span style="font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;">GUID attribute has no required syntax and does not impact on compliance with this specification.

## <a name="_Toc480804296"></a><a name="_Toc409028198">5.4 Syntax for eId and wId attributes</a>

Most elements in the Akoma Ntoso XML vocabulary allow two optional attributes, called wId. They are optional for compliance level 1, and are required for compliance levels 2 and above.

The syntax for these attributes is identical and is built in the exact same way, but are based on different elements:

eId attribute, the reference element is the one in the current Expression

wId attribute, the reference element is the one in the master Expression, as specified in section 5.4.

The generic syntax for these attributes is the following:

<div style="border-top:solid windowtext 1.0pt;border-left:none;border-bottom:
solid windowtext 1.0pt;border-right:none;padding:3.0pt 0in 3.0pt 0in;
background:#D9D9D9;margin-left:.3in;margin-right:.3in">

          [prefix “__”] element_ref [“_”number]



*   prefix is a (possibly empty) string providing uniqueness to the remaining part of the identifier, and it is based on the context in which the element appears;
*    is a (required) identifier of the type of the element;
*   number <span style="font-family:
         &quot;Courier New&quot;"> is a (possibly empty) representation of the numbering of the element within its context.

### <a name="_Toc480804297"></a><a name="_Toc409028199"></a><a name="__RefHeading__1357_1724725076">5.4.1 Prefix</a>

Frequently elements appear in different parts of the same document with the same number and they need to be identified by the context in which they appear: for instance, a _Chapter 2_ may exist within both _Book I_ and _Book II_, and a line 5 most probably exists in every page of some document.

The context is the part of the identifier that provides the required uniqueness. Thus, the context of the two instances of Chapter 2 is Book I or Book II respectively, while the context for each line 5 (i.e., each eop> element).

The prefix is a (possibly empty) string providing uniqueness to the remaining part of the identifier, and it is based on the context in which the element appears. In fact, by construction the prefix is _the full identifier of the context element_.

For example:

book_I__chp_2,  
The prefix part of Chapter 2 within Book I is “book_I”, which is the identifier of the element “Book I” that provides the context for the rest of the identifier.

eop_2”, which is the identifier of the element between page 2 and page 3 that provides the context for the rest of the identifier_._

Composite documents make it more complex to reach uniqueness of identifiers over the whole XML document, since they might be the result of composing individual documents where the same identifiers may exist independently. For instance, an element called _section 2_ may exist independently in the main component and in an annex of the same document.

The identifier of an element MUST therefore include the full identifier of the context element that guarantees its uniqueness, and it CAN be the identifier of the individual document in a composite document, the identifier of a wrapping element that restarts the numbering, or the identifier of a preceding element that restarts the numbering.

Structures within the art_4a” in the final result.

The following are usual cases of contexts:

<doc>, etc.) are always contexts. This means that, except particular cases, all numbers restart whenever a new document class is started (e.g., in a composite document each document component has its own local numbering).

are always contexts, even ifthey do not force a restart of the numbering, but just a different numbering context within themselves.

is always a context.

1.     Some elements share the same _element_ref_. This happens when the two elements has the common user semantic but are found in different structural contexts. These elements are:

The reason for these elements to have the same _element_ref_ is to reduce the complexity whenever the structures are functionally identical.

2.     For some elements, an abbreviation is used. This abbreviation is a well-known shorthand of the full element name that is already used in legal citations. The following is the full list of abbreviations allowed:

### <a name="_Toc480804299"></a><a name="_Toc409028203"></a><a name="__RefHeading__1363_1724725076">5.4.3 Num</a>ber

The number part of an identifier is a (possibly empty) representation of the numbering of the element within its context.

There are three subcases:

1.     Globally and locally unique elements:

If the element is necessarily unique within its context, no numbering is used, and therefore there is no `number` part. For instance, since there is exactly one content element inside articles or sections, the identifier of the `<content>` element of article 12 will be simply “`art_12__content`”.

2.     Explicitly numbered elements

An explicitly numbered element has its number determined in the Expression itself in the form of a art_-1”. 

3.     Implicitly numbered elements.

An implicitly numbered element has no `<num>` sub-element, and its numbering is established by counting the occurrences of similar elements within the same context, always using Arabic numbers. It is the job of the author of the Manifestation to determine whether the best way to count these elements is globally (i.e., starting at 1 at the beginning of the document class) or locally (i.e., restarting at 1 inside or after every instance of an intermediate element). This naming convention provides no rules on this choice, but there are a few common sense approaches. For instance, it is very natural that `<eop>` elements are globally counted, and `<eol>` are locally counted by their preceding `<eop>` element, and as such, the third `<eop>` element (the one separating the third page from the fourth) has identifier “`eop_3`” (note no prefix), while the fifteenth end of line after such `eop` (the one separating the fifteenth line from the sixteenth) will have as identifier “`eop_3__eol_15`”. On the other hand, `<p>` elements within a given structure are probably counted locally (as in “third <content> element), but any containing or preceding element that in the opinion of the author of the Manifestation provides context for the counting. Thus the third `<p>` of section 12 could reasonably have “`sec_12__p_3`” as its identifier.

## <a name="_Toc480804300"></a><a name="_Toc409028204">5.5 Usage Rules for “eId” and “wId”</a>

Documents are complex structures. Sometime, it is important to record the fact that the (conceptually) same structure may have different content (e.g., for different languages, different versions or different audiences).

Permanent identifiers are the basic tool to be able to identify the concept of _sameness_ across situations that require different content to be known as really being the same. Unfortunately, relying only on a permanent identifier prevents some common and very useful operations to be performed on documents that present multiple instances of the same structure. For this reason the concepts of Expression identifiers (`eId`) and Work identifiers (`wId`) have been introduced.

### <a name="_Toc480804302"></a><a name="_Toc409028206">5.5.2 The Master Expression</a>

1.     Whether an XML document does or does not have Work-level identifiers is NOT a decision of the author of the Manifestation, but a characteristic of the nature of the document. In fact, if an XML document does NOT have Work-level identifiers, then it is assumed that:

(a)   it is the Master Expression (the one whose Expression-level identifiers will be used as a map for the Work-level identifiers of all the other expressions) and

(b)   its Work-level identifiers are the same as Expression-level identifiers.

If this is NOT the Master Expression, then the Work-level identifiers NEED to be present as soon as they become different from the corresponding Expression-level Identifiers.

Master Expressions are necessarily the FIRST (or the ONLY) time-related versions of a document that either is intrinsically MONOLINGUAL or is expressed in the MASTER LANGUAGE, which is country- and jurisdiction- dependent and may even not exist (as in EU).

A Manifestation author must know whether the document being marked up should be considered as the Master Expression for a Work or not.

The Expression-level identifiers use a semantic naming convention based on the structure of their Expression.  The Work-level identifiers use a semantic naming convention based on the structure of their Master Expression, if one exists, or of a conceptual Ur-Expression, if none exists.

### <a name="_Toc480804303"></a><a name="_Toc409028207">5.5.3 wId Attribute Use Cases</a>

The decision to use two separate identifiers is to avoid the risk of collapsing two potentially very different meanings of “identification” into just one identifier: the identifier of the _right place_ (_the one that I mean now when I use this identifier)_ and the identifier of the _same place_ (_the one that had such an identifier in a different version or in a different variant of this document_).

In fact there are really two identifiers at work: one has the purpose of matching the evolving nature of the fragment with respect to the internal structure of the document and the other must guarantee the persistency of the identity of the fragment across versions and variants. They are usually the same, and diverge only when one of the four following situations occur:

1.     In multilingual works, the concurrence of multiple similarly named structures in multiple expressions, say article 2 in the French version of a document and section 2 in the English version of the same document, both referring to the same conceptual structure. A first subcase of this situation is when a master language can be identified, which provides a clear Master Expression, and a second subcase is when no master language is provided (e.g., in European legislation), so that no Master Expression exists. 

2.     In a multi-version file, the co-occurrence of two similarly named structures from two versions, say article 2 in the past version and article 2 in the current version, both contained in the same (multi-version) Manifestation.

3.     In a modification act, the concurrence of two similarly named structures of the amending and of the amended document, say I am amending art.2 of the amended act, and of course an art.2 that exists already somewhere else in the amending act.

4.     In a chain of versions, the requirement to renumber a few structures that completely desynchronizes the old identification mechanisms from the new one, e.g., article 2 is from now on known as article 15\. Such renumbering is frequent in bills, and rare in acts. But external references to bills are mainly static (i.e., they refer to a specific version of a bill), while external references to acts are often dynamic (i.e., they refer to any of a number of versions depending on the nature of the quest).

       First use case – renumbering in bills: an approved amendment A inserts a new article between art.1 and art.2 of version 1 of bill B. Because of this decision, art.2 is known in version 2 of B as art.3, art.3 is known as art.4, etc.

       Second use case – renumbering in acts: while act Y is in version 1, on date D1 act X makes a (dynamic) reference to art.2 of act Y. Subsequently, on date D2, act Y gets renumbered, and in version 2 art.2 becomes art.15 and a new art.2 is introduced in its stead. Subsequently, on date 3, act W makes a (dynamic) reference to art.15 of act Y (which is the new name for art.2) and on date D4 act Z makes a reference to art.2 of act Y (which is a new article that did not exist previously).

Given the above-mentioned principles, the natural solution is to have two identifiers to deal with. One is persistent and associated to the Work, while the other is evolving in time and associated to the Expression. Whenever the persistent identifier and the evolving identifier do not differ, only one of them is specified in the document, but when they differ, then the evolving identifier follows the structure of the Expression, while the permanent identifier is anchored to the structure of one specific Expression, called _Master Expression_, which is considered as the fundamental Expression for the permanent identification of fragments.

When a situation occurs that requires the two identifiers to differ from each other, such as one of the above-mentioned situations 1, 2, 3 or 4, then the eId) keeps on being updated according to the condition of the Expression it belongs to.

Tracking is always based on the `wId`, navigation is always based on the identifier that was the  eId.

For instance, we can describe the four situations as follows.

#### <a name="_Toc480804304"></a><a name="_Toc409028208">5.5.3.1 Multi-Lingual Document</a>

##### <a name="_Toc480804305">5.5.3.1.1 Subcase a</a>

Two expressions exist in two different languages. One is in the master, or default language, and the other is an additional variant in a different language. As such, the version in the default language is the master Expression, and the other version uses the master Expression’s identifiers as `wIds`.

Representing the fact that article 2 in the secondary variant contains the same text as section 2 in the master Expression is performed as follows:

Master Expression (e.g., in English)

<div style="border-top:solid windowtext 1.0pt;border-left:none;border-bottom:

##### <a name="_Toc480804306">5.5.3.1.2 Subcase b</a>

Two expressions exist in two different languages, but neither can be determined as the default or master language. This happens, for instance, in European legislation. As such, the master Expression does not exist in a concrete Expression, but must be determined abstractly (it could be called an _UR-Expression_), and both versions uses the UR-Expression’s identifiers as wIds.

How do we represent that article 2 in the French version contains the same text as section 2 in the English version, and neither is the master Expression?:

#### <a name="_Toc480804307"></a><a name="_Toc409028209">5.5.3.2 Multi-Version Document</a>

In a multi-version file, two similarly named structures exist coming from two different versions, say article 2 in the past version and article 2 in the current version, both must be placed in the same (multi-version) Manifestation.

The “default” structure (e.g., the current version) uses a plain wId identifier.

<div style="border-top:solid windowtext 1.0pt;border-left:none;border-bottom:
solid windowtext 1.0pt;border-right:none;padding:3.0pt 0in 3.0pt 0in;

  <num>2</num>

<content>

              <p>Old version of art.2</p>

  </content>

</art>



In this situation it is assumed that the expected default behavior when traversing documents is to go to the newer version of the document, and if the navigation mechanism knows something more specific about the needs of the user, it would lead to the older version of the fragment instead.

#### <a name="_Toc480804309"></a><a name="_Toc409028211">5.5.3.4 Renumbering of a Bill</a>

The first version of the bill has simple identifiers:

<div style="border-top:solid windowtext 1.0pt;border-left:none;border-bottom:
solid windowtext 1.0pt;border-right:none;padding:3.0pt 0in 3.0pt 0in;
background:#D9D9D9;margin-left:.3in;margin-right:.3in">

<article eId=”art_1”>

  <num>1</num>

<content><p>Originally article 1</p></content>

</article>

<article eId= ”art_2 ”>

  <num>2</num>

<content><p>Originally article 2</p></content>

</article>

<article eId=”art_3”>

  <num>3</num>

<content><p>Originally article 3</p></content>

</article>



 

In the second version of the bill a new article 2 was inserted, which generated a renumbering of the subsequent articles. This version uses identifiers to specify the original identifiers, regardless of the position, and uses eId to specify the identifier each article should have if this were a new document.

<div style="border-top:solid windowtext 1.0pt;border-left:none;border-bottom:
solid windowtext 1.0pt;border-right:none;padding:3.0pt 0in 3.0pt 0in;
background:#D9D9D9;margin-left:.3in;margin-right:.3in">

<article eId=”art_1”>

  <num>1</num>

<content><p>Originally article 1</p></content>

</article>

<article eId= ”art_2 ”>

  <num>2</num>

<content><p>New article 2</p></content>

</article>

<article wId=”art_2” eId=”art_3”>

<num>3</num>

  <content><p>Originally article 2</p></content>

</article>

<article wId=”art_3” eId=”art_4”>

<num>4</num>

  <content><p>Originally article 3</p></content>

</article>



Since bills mostly receive static references, and since static references always include the version number, it is always very clear what refers to what – references to art_2 in version 2 will lead to the newly inserted article.

#### <a name="_Toc480804310"></a><a name="_Toc409028212">5.5.3.5 Renumbering of Acts</a>

Suppose that, while act Y is in version 1, on date D1 act X makes a (Work-level) reference to art.2 of act Y. Subsequently, on date D2, act Y gets renumbered, and in version 2 art.2 becomes art.15 and a new art.2 is introduced in its stead. Subsequently, on date 3, act W makes a (dynamic) reference to art.15 of act Y (which is the new name for art.2) and on date D4 act Z makes a reference to art.2 of act Y (which is a new article that did not exist previously)”.

The structure of the document is similar to the previous example. Then the following facts would be true[[6]](#_ftn6):

eId=”art_2”.

wId=”art_2”

wId.

When accessing one of these references, the date of the source Expression (i.e., the one containing the reference must be compared with the date of the Expression of the destination document. If the date of the source is before the date of the destination, then the eId must be used.

[[3]](#_ftnref3) this is a simplification of RFC 3986, that calls global IRI refs as “absolute path references” and local IRI refs as “relative path references”.





[[4]](#_ftnref4) Contiguity does NOT mean that the identifier must be called "id", or that it must be the only attribute to exhibit identification characteristics





[[5]](#_ftnref5) Transferability does not mean "identical value", but only that a transformation between the two values must be possible in an automatic way.





[is the identifier of the portion.
