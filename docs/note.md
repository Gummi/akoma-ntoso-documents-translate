Introduction

This appeal is against the Ruling of the High Court delivered on the 6thFebruary, 2007. In the Ruling, the learned trial judge dismissed the election petition of the appellant on a preliminary point of law. For convenience, the appellant shall be referred to as the petitioner, while the 1stand the 2ndrespondents shall retain their positions as this is what they were in the court below.

這個上訴反對高等法院2007年2月6日交付的裁決。在裁決中，被告的審判法官在初步法律上駁回了上訴人的選舉請願書。 為方便起見，上訴人應被視為呈請人，而1名記者應保留其立場，因為他們在下面的法院。

Background

The brief facts, common to both sides and which gave rise to the preliminary issues, were that the petitioner stood as a parliamentary candidate in the Malole Constituency in the Northern Province. Being dissatisfied with the election results, she instructed counsel to petition and a petition was duly filed. After a few days, an amended petition was filed. According to the record, all this was done within 30 days in compliance with Section 96 of the Electoral Act No. 12 of 2006 (hereinafter to be referred to as "the Act"). The petition, among other things, sought to declare the election of the 2ndrespondent null and void; declare the appellant as the duly elected Member of Parliament for Malole Constituency and, therefore, entitled to take her seat in the National Assembly and enjoy all the benefits due to that office.

雙方共同的事實引起了初步的問題，是請願人在北部的馬洛選區中擔任議會候選人。 對選舉結果不滿意，她指示律師提出請願，並提出申請。 幾天后，提交了一份修改後的請願書。 根據記錄，所有這一切都是根據2006年第12號選舉法第96節（以下簡稱“該法”）在30天內完成的。 請願書除其他外，設法宣布選舉二號通知無效; 宣布上訴人為正式當選的馬勒選區議員，因此有權在國民議會中坐席，並享有該辦事處的所有利益。

Motivation

The preliminary issues, as points of law, were disposed of through submissions by counsel representing the parties to the election petition. Mr. Lambda, counsel for the 2ndrespondent, submitted first because he had formally filed the 2ndrespondent's notice to raise preliminary issues. According to the record, the formal notice was in response to the learned trial Judge's observations as to what status to accord the election petition that was not signed by the petitioner herself in compliance with the provisions of Section 96(3) of the Act.

The preliminary issues raised were in three parts. Without reproducing them, we shall, for the purposes of this appeal, take the first one, which was not only vigorously argued before the lower court and this court but which is also the subject of appeal.

As recast by counsel for the 2ndrespondent and argued by the parties, the issue was:whether a petition filed into court and not signed by the petitioner herself can be said to be properly before the court and whether or not the court can entertain the petition or indeed allow an amendment

Mr. Lambda contended before the learned trial Judge that it was a mandatory requirement that the petition is signed by the petitioner in person and not through her legal representative; that an adherence to the procedure provided by the Act was of the utmost importance.

Counsel contended that the omission by the petitioner, in not signing the petition herself, was so fatal that it rendered the petition dismissible in its current form for want of procedure; that any defect in the petition could only be corrected within 30 days, the period stipulated for bringing the petition to court.

The record shows that Mr. Kappa, counsel for the 1strespondent, did not submit before the learned trial Judge because he was constrained by the application on account of what happened on their part during the elections. He, therefore, found it appropriate not to offer any position.

In response to the submissions by counsel for the 2ndrespondent, Mr. Eta, counsel for the petitioner, submitted before the learned trial Judge that the issue that had arisen related to or rested on a proper construction of Section 96(3) of the Act.

To that extent, counsel told the trial court that a petition was a pleading just like a statement of claim or defence. With reference to Halsbury's Laws of England. 4th Edition , counsel submitted that where a pleading is settled by counsel it must be signed by him or her. He, therefore, contended that the petition before the trial court, signed by the petitioner through her counsel, was properly signed as counsel did not have an existence or life independent of a client.

初步問題作為法律點，通過代表選舉請願方當事人的律師的呈件予以處理。由於他已經正式提出了通訊員的通知來提出初步問題，因此第二名記者的律師是首先提交的。根據記錄，正式通知是針對法庭對法官根據該法第96（3）條的規定未經申請人自己簽署的選舉請願的意見作出的回應。

提出的初步問題分三個部分。不用複制它們，為了上訴的目的，我們將第一個不僅在下級法院和本法院大力爭辯，而且也是上訴的對象。

由於二讀通知員由雙方律師重新指稱，問題是：呈請人提交法院而不是由呈請人自己簽名的請願書可以說是適當地提交法院，以及法院是否可以接受請願書或確實允許修改

拉姆斯先生在法庭審判法官面前強調，呈請人親自簽署，而不是通過法定代表人簽署的強制性規定;遵守該法提供的程序是至關重要的。

律師認為，請願人在不簽署請願書時遺漏是非常致命的，使得請願以目前的形式因為程序而被駁回;請願書中的任何缺陷只能在30天內，將呈請呈交給法庭的期限予以糾正。

記錄顯示，記者的顧問卡帕先生沒有在審判法官面前提交，因為他因選舉中發生的事情受到申請的限制。因此，他認為不適合提供任何立場。

為回應律師向記者提交的意見書，請願人律師Eta先生在法庭審理前提交了與該法案第96（3）條適當建立相關或依賴的問題。

在這個程度上，律師告訴初審法庭，請願書是一個懇求，就像聲明或辯護聲明一樣。參考哈茨伯里英國法。律師第四版提出，如果律師由律師解決，則必須由他或她簽署。因此，他認為，請願人通過律師簽署的審判法庭請願書已經妥為簽署，因為律師沒有獨立於客戶的存在或生命。

約翰·阿迪斯（John Adamis）是這個判斷事實的一部分。

Dicision

In summary, our position is that the appeal has no merit. We reiterate our finding that Section 96(3), as read with Section 2(1), makes it mandatory for the petitioner to sign the petition personally under her or his hand before presenting it to the High Court for trial and determination. As this was a novel appeal case on a matter of public interest, we shall make no order for costs. Each party to bear it own costs.

總之，我們的立場是上訴沒有價值。 我們再次重申我們的裁決，即第96（3）條，與第2（1）條一併閱讀，規定請願人親自簽署請願書，然後提交高等法院審判。 由於這是一個關於公眾利益的新型上訴案件，我們不作出任何命令。 各方承擔自己的費用。

SUMMARY:  Delict–pure economic loss–meaning of–policy considerations relevant in determining wrongfulness–remoteness of damage–application of flexible test

摘要：純粹的經濟損失 - 與確定不法性相關的政策考慮 - 破壞的偏遠 - 靈活測試的應用

Background

[1]
The appellant ('Fourway') is a long distance haulier. The respondent ('the Agency') owes its existence to the South African National Roads Agency Limited and National Roads Act 7 of 1998 ('the Act'). The dispute between them originates from an accident which occurred in the early evening of 26 September 2003 on the N1 national road between Polokwane and Mokopane in the Limpopo province. The two vehicles involved were an articulated truck and a light delivery van. The articulated truck was driven at the time by an employee of Fourway who was acting in the course and scope of his employment.

[2]
The articulated truck was on its way from an asbestos mine in Zimbabwe to Durban harbour carrying about 34 tonnes of chrysolite asbestos, destined for export. As a result of the collision, the truck overturned and spilled its cargo onto practically the entire surface of a portion of the national road and its surroundings. Because of the hazardous nature of asbestos powder, the spillage required an extensive cleaning-up and decontamination operation.

[3]
To facilitate the cleaning-up and decontamination process, the traffic authorities closed the section of the national road involved and diverted the traffic in both directions onto an alternative road. This lasted for about 24 hours. The section of the national road which was closed forms part of a toll road. The alternative route was not subject to toll. As a result of the closure, two toll plazas – as defined in the Act – could not collect toll fees. Based on these facts, the agency as the entity authorised by s 27 of the Act to levy and collect toll fees on toll roads, instituted an action in delict against Fourway for the damages it allegedly suffered in the form of loss of toll revenue in an amount ofR105 996.67.

[1]
上訴人（“Fourway”）是長途運輸工具。答辯人（“原子能機構”）歸屬於南非國家路政署有限公司和1998年國民道路法（“該法案”）。它們之間的爭端起因於發生在2003年9月26日傍晚在林波波省的Polokwane和Mokopane之間的N1國道上的事故。這兩輛車是一輛鉸接式卡車和一輛輕型貨車。鉸接式卡車當時是由Fourway的僱員在當時的行動中進行的。

[2]
鉸接式卡車正在從津巴布韋的石棉礦進入德班港，運送約34噸石灰石，用於出口。由於碰撞的結果，卡車將其貨物傾倒並灑落到幾乎整個國道及其周邊地區的整個表面上。由於石棉粉的危險性，溢出物需要進行廣泛的清除和去污操作。

[3]
為了方便清理和淨化過程，交通管理部門關閉了涉及的國道的一段，將交通雙向轉向另一條道路。這持續了大約24小時。關閉的國道的一段是收費公路的一部分。替代路線沒有收費。由於關閉，法案規定的兩個收費廣場不能收取路費。根據這些事實，該機構作為該法第27條授權的實體徵收收費道路上的收費費用，對Fourways因違反通行費收入而造成的損失提起訴訟金額為R105 996.67。

Introduction


[4]
At the commencement of the trial, the parties asked the court a quo (Rabie J) to order a separation of issues. In terms of the separation order, the issues relating to the liability of Fourway were to be decided first, while the quantum of the Agency's alleged damages stood over for later determination. The preliminary issues were decided in favour of the agency. Hence the court declared Fourway liable for such damages as the Agency may prove in respect of the lost revenue it would have collected at the two toll plazas involved, but for the closure of the road. It also ordered Fourway to pay the costs of the preliminary proceedings. Fourway's appeal against that judgment is with the leave of the court a quo.

[5]
Part of the controversy on appeal was brought about by a shift in the focus of the defence advanced by Fourway and the resulting mutation of the issues involved. A convenient starting point for an account of the mutation is the opening address by counsel for the Agency, as plaintiff, at the beginning of the trial. With reference to the pleadings, counsel at that stage defined the issues between the parties as follows:

(a)
Whether or not the respondent had the necessary authority to collect toll fees on that portion of the toll road which was closed as a result of the collision.

(b)
Whether the collision occurred as a result of the negligence of the driver employed by Fourway.

(c)
Whether the occurrence of the collision necessitated the decontamination operation and the closure of the road.

[6]
Counsel for Fourway did not react to this definition of the issues. During the trial, Fourway formally conceded the issue referred to in (a) and the evidence led by the parties therefore dealt exclusively with the issues in (b) and (c) . But in argument at the end of the trial, Fourway's counsel, for the first time, raised two further contentions. First he submitted that the Agency's claim was for the recovery of pure economic loss which required the existence of a legal duty on the part of Fourway and that the Agency had failed to plead or establish the existence of such a legal duty. Secondly he submitted that the Agency had failed to establish the requirement of legal causation with reference to the loss which formed the basis of its claim.

[7]
As we know from the result, the court a quo dismissed all defences relied on by Fourway, including those originally raised under what I categorised as (b) and (c) , as well as the two new ones advanced for the first time in argument at the end of the trial. As to (b) and (c) the court found on the evidence presented that the negligence of Fourway's employee was the cause of the collision which necessitated both the decontamination process and the closure of the road. With regard to the defence based on the concept of pure economic loss, the court essentially held that the damage suffered by the agency did not amount to pure economic loss and that the question regarding the existence of a legal duty therefore did not arise. Finally the court held that the damages claimed could not be classified as too remote and that the requirement of legal causation had thus been satisfied.

[8]
On appeal, it was conceded on behalf of Fourway that the court a quo was correct in deciding the issues under (b) and (c) against it. In consequence, the only issues on appeal turned on the contentions that were raised for the first time in argument at the end of the trial. They can be summarised thus:

(a)
Whether the court a quo correctly came to the conclusion that the Agency's claim is not a claim for pure economic loss.

(b)
If not, how the issue of wrongfulness should have been dealt with in the light of the fact that it was not pertinently raised in the pleadings.

(c)
Whether the court a quo correctly came to the conclusion that the damages claim by the Agency cannot be regarded as too remote.

[9]
The court a quo's finding that the damages claimed did not result from pure economic loss clearly emanated from its understanding of that concept. That understanding appears from the following statements in the judgment:'The economic loss in this sense comprises patrimonial loss that does not result from a direct invasion of a subjective right of the person who suffered the loss.'And that'the aforesaid rights of the plaintiff. . . [ie the Agency's statutory rights to operate a toll road and to collect toll fees] were clearly subjective rights worthy of protection and which the plaintiff could enforce against other people.'And that'[c]onsequently, the loss suffered by the plaintiff is not a so-called pure economic loss, but the direct result of a direct infringement of subjective rights which was as such unlawful.'

[4]
在審訊開始時，雙方當事人要求法院（Rabie J）下令分離問題。在分離令方面，與Fourway的責任有關的問題首先要作出決定，而原子能機構所稱的損害賠償金的數額卻被擱置了以備後來確定。這些初步問題是由該機構決定的。因此，法院宣布Fourway負責賠償原子能機構可能就所涉及的兩個收費廣場收取的收入損失，但關閉道路方面可能會證明。它還命令Fourway支付初步程序的費用。 Fourway對這一判決的上訴是由法院離開。

[5]
上訴的一部分爭議是由Fourway提出的防務重點轉移，導致涉及問題的突變。關於突變的一個方便的起點是原告工作的律師在審判開始時作為原告的開庭地址。關於訴狀，該階段的律師界定了雙方之間的問題如下：

（一個）
答辯人是否有必要的權力來收取由於碰撞而關閉的收費公路的部分收費。

（b）中
是否由於Fourway所僱用的司機的疏忽而發生碰撞。

（C）
碰撞的發生是否需要去污操作和關閉道路。

[6]
Fourway律師沒有對這個問題的定義作出反應。在審訊期間，四路正式承認了（a）所述的問題，由雙方領導的證據完全由（b）和（c）的問題處理。但是，在審判結束時，Fourway的律師首次提出另外兩個爭論。首先，他表示原子能機構的要求是為了恢復純粹的經濟損失，要求Fourway有法律義務，原子能機構沒有懇求或確定存在這種法律義務。其次，他認為原子能機構沒有根據構成其索賠依據的損失確定法律因果關係的規定。

[7]
正如我們從結果中所知道的，法院駁回了Fourway依賴的所有防禦，包括根據我分類為（b）和（c）的原來提出的所有防禦，以及第一次提出的兩個新的辯護在審判結束時。至於（b）及（c），法庭裁定有關證據顯示，Fourway的僱員疏忽是造成碰撞的原因，因此必須進行除污處理和關閉道路。關於基於純經濟損失概念的辯護，法院基本上認為，該機構遭受的損害並不等於純粹的經濟損失，因此沒有出現關於存在法律責任的問題。最後，法院認定，索賠的損害賠償不能被歸類為太偏遠，因此法律因果關係的要求得到了滿足。

[8]
在上訴時，代表Fourway承認，法院在決定（b）和（c）項下的問題時是否正確。因此，唯一的上訴問題就是在審訊結束時首次提出的爭論。因此可以總結：

（a）
法院是否正確地得出結論，原子能機構的索賠不是純粹的經濟損失的索賠。

（b）中
如果不是，如果在訴狀中沒有提到這個事實，應該如何處理不法性問題。

（C）
法院是否正確地得出原子能機構的賠償要求不能被認為太偏遠的結論。

[9]
法院認定，索賠的損害賠償並不是由於對這一概念的理解而產生的純經濟損失。這種理解從以下判決中可以看出：“在這個意義上的經濟損失是由直接入侵受害者的主觀權利所造成的遺產損失。”而且，原告。 。 。 [即原子能機構的經營收費公路的法定權利和收費費用]顯然是值得保護的主觀權利，原告人可以對其他人執行。“然後，原告人遭受的損失是不是所謂的純粹的經濟損失，而是直接侵害主觀權利的直接後果是非法的。“

Motivation


[10]
I do not share the court a quo's understanding of what is meant by 'pure economic loss' in the present context. I believe its meaning to be far less metaphysical. As explained by Harms JA in Telematrix (Pty) Ltd v Advertising Standards Authority SA 2006 (1) SA 461 (SCA) para 1, it means simply this:'"Pure economic loss" in this context connotes loss that does not arise directly from damage to the plaintiff's person or property but rather in consequence of the negligent act itself, such as loss of profit, being put to extra expenses or the diminution in the value of property.'(See also Lillicrap, Wassenaar and Partners v Pilkington Brothers (SA) (Pty) Ltd1985 (1) SA 475 (A) 497I-498H ; Trustees, Two Oceans Aquarium Trust v Kantey & Templer (Pty) Ltd2006 (3) SA 138 (SCA) para 14 ; Wille's Principles of South African Law9 ed, (General editor: Francois du Bois) sv 'Delict' by Daniel Visser, 1105 ; Neethling, Potgieter & Visser,Law of Delict, 5 ed 268 et seq).

[11]
Thus understood, the Agency's claim, in my view, falls squarely within the ambit of pure economic loss. As formulated, its claim was for loss of revenue in the form of toll fees resulting from the closure of the road. The Agency did not allege, nor did it set out to prove in evidence, that it was the owner of the road; that the road was physically damaged by the collision; or that the closure of the road resulted from any physical damage to the road. The Agency's argument on appeal, that in terms of s 7 of the Act it was in fact the owner of the road on which the collision occurred, is of no consequence and misses the point. For present purposes the question is not whether the Agency is in fact the owner of the road. The point is that it did not rely on such ownership to support its claim.

[12]
Recognition that we are dealing with a claim for pure economic loss brings in its wake a different approach to the element of wrongfulness. This results from the principles which have been formulated by this court so many times in the recent past that I believe they can by now be regarded as trite. These principles proceed from the premise that negligent conduct which manifests itself in the form of a positive act causing physical damage to the property or person of another is prima facie wrongful. By contrast, negligent causation of pure economic loss is not regarded as prima facie wrongful. Its wrongfulness depends on the existence of a legal duty. The imposition of this legal duty is a matter for judicial determination involving criteria of public or legal policy consistent with constitutional norms. In the result, conduct causing pure economic loss will only be regarded as wrongful and therefore actionable if public or legal policy considerations require that such conduct, if negligent, should attract legal liability for the resulting damages (see eg Minister of Safety and Security v Van Duivenboden2002 (6) SA 431 (SCA) paras 12 and 22 ;Gouda Boerdery BK v Transnet 2005 (5) SA 490 (SCA) para 12 ;Telematrix (supra)paras 13-14;Trustees, Two Oceans Aquarium Trust (supra)paras 10-12).

[13]
In this light, so Fourway contended on appeal, the Agency was obliged to allege in its pleadings not only that the negligent conduct relied upon was wrongful, but that it also had to allege and prove the facts relied upon to substantiate the considerations of policy giving rise to a legal duty on the part of Fourway's employee. As a result of the Agency's failure to adhere to these rules of litigation, so the argument went, neither the policy considerations relevant to the question of wrongfulness, nor the factual basis underlying such policy considerations, were identified and investigated during the trial. In consequence, so the argument concluded, it would be prejudiced if the issue of wrongfulness were to be summarily disposed of at the appeal. Fourway therefore suggested that, unless this court upholds its contention that the damages claimed are too remote – to which I shall presently return – the issue of wrongfulness should be postponed and decided with the rest of the issues concerning the quantum of the Agency's damages, which are standing over in any event.

[14]
The proposition that a plaintiff claiming pure economic loss must allege wrongfulness, and plead the facts relied upon to support that essential allegation, is in principle well founded. In fact, the absence of such allegations may render the particulars of claim exipiable on the basis that no cause of action had been disclosed (see egTrope v SA Reserve Bank1992 (3) SA 208 (T) at 214A-G;Indac Electronics (Pty) Ltd v Volkskas Bank Ltd1992 (1) SA 783 (A) 797E;Telematrix (supra)para 2). But, as we know, Fourway did not file an exception. The trial proceeded without any objection on its part. In the circumstances it would be futile to investigate whether an exception, if properly and timeously taken, would have been successful. As I see it, the question is rather whether, despite the lack of necessary allegations in the Agency's pleadings, Fourway had sufficient opportunity to produce the facts it would seek to rely on for the determination of the policy considerations pertaining to wrongfulness in its favour. Conversely stated, the question is whether Fourway has shown prejudice, in the sense that it would have conducted its case in a materially different way if the Agency's claim for pure economic loss had been properly pleaded. (See egShill v Milner1937 AD 101 at 105;Robinson v Randfontein Estates GM Co Ltd1925 AD 173 at 198;Collen v Rietfontein Engineering Works1948 (1) SA 413 (A) at 433;Stead v Conradie1995 (2) SA 111 (A) at 122A-H.)

[15]
As I see it, the proposal by Fourway that the issue of wrongfulness be referred back for determination by the trial court therefore depends on the outcome of two discrete enquiries. First, can this court, on the basis of the facts available, decide that, as a matter of policy, Fourway should be held liable for the loss of revenue claimed by the Agency? If not, that would be the end of the matter. The Agency would have failed to make out a case. A decision on the other hand that the issue of wrongfulness should on the facts available be determined in favour of the Agency will lead to the next enquiry. The question is: can it be said that, if the issue of wrongfulness had been properly pleaded by the Agency, Fourway would have conducted its case any differently? If not, the Agency is entitled to succeed. It is therefore only a finding of potential prejudice on the part of Fourway that can justify a referral back to the trial court.

[10]
在現在的情況下，我不同意法院對“純經濟損失”的含義的理解。我相信它的意義遠不如形而上學。如Harmat JA在Telematrix（Pty）Ltd v廣告標準局SA 2006（1）SA 461（SCA）第1段）中所解釋的，這就意味著：“這個上下文中的”純經濟損失“是指直接從原告人或財產的損害，而是由於疏忽行為本身造成的損失，如利潤損失，額外費用或物業價值的減少。“（另見Lillicrap，Wassenaar和Partners v Pilkington Brothers（ SA）（Pty）Ltd1985（1）SA 475（A）497I-498H;受託人，兩個海洋水族館信託v Kantey＆Templer（Pty）Ltd2006（3）SA 138（SCA）第14段; Wille的“南非法律原則”9 ，（General editor：Francois du Bois）sv'Delict'，Daniel Visser，1105; Neethling，Potgieter＆Visser，Law of Delict，5 ed 268 et seq）。

[11]
據此了解，原子能機構的索賠在我看來完全落在純經濟損失的範圍之內。根據制定，其索賠是因道路封閉而導致的收費損失。原子能機構沒有指控，也沒有提出證據證明是道路的擁有者;道路由於碰撞而身體受損;或道路的封閉是由道路的任何物理損壞造成的。原子能機構上訴的論點，就法令第7條而言，實際上是發生碰撞的道路的擁有者，這是沒有任何後果的，也沒有錯。為了目前的目的，問題不在於原子能機構事實上是道路的擁有者。關鍵在於它不依賴這種所有權來支持其主張。

[12]
承認我們正在處理純粹的經濟損失的索賠，使其對不法性因素採取不同的方法。這是由於近年來這個法院多次提出的原則，我相信現在可以說是諷刺的。這些原則的前提是，這種表現為以積極行為為導向對另一人的財產或人造成實際損害的形式的疏忽行為是首要的不法行為。相比之下，純粹的經濟損失的疏忽原因並不被認為是初步的不法行為。其不法性取決於是否存在法律義務。實行這項法律責任是涉及符合憲法規範的公共或法律政策標準的司法裁決問題。因此，導致純粹的經濟損失的行為只會被視為不法行為，因此，如果公共或法律政策考慮要求這種行為（如果疏忽）應對所造成的損害賠償引起法律責任（見例如安全和安保部長v Van Duvateboden2002（6）SA 431（SCA）第12和22段; Gouda Boerdery BK v Transnet 2005（5）SA 490（SCA）第12段; Telematrix（同上）第13-14段;受託人，兩個海洋水族館信託10-12）。

[13]
就此而言，四方對此提出上訴，原子能機構不得不在其訴狀中聲稱，所依賴的疏忽行為是不法行為，但也必須指稱和證明所依據的事實，以證明政策給予的考慮四通員工履行法定職責。由於原子能機構未能遵守這些訴訟規則，所以辯論是在審判期間確定和調查了與不法性問題有關的政策考慮，也沒有考慮到這種政策考慮的事實依據。因此，結論是這樣的話，如果在上訴期間立即處理不法性問題，將會受到損害。因此，Fourway建議，除非本法院堅持認為索賠的損害賠償太偏遠 - 我現在應該返回的 - 不法性問題應該推遲和決定，其餘的涉及原子能機構損害賠償的問題，其中在任何情況下都站了起來。

[14]
原告聲稱純經濟損失的主張，必須指責不法性，並懇求支持這項基本指控所依賴的事實，原則上是有根據的。事實上，沒有這種指控可能會使索賠的細節因為沒有任何訴訟原因被披露（參見例如，214A-G的Indro Electronics（Pty） ）Ltd v Volkskas Bank Ltd1992（1）SA 783（A）797E; Telematrix（同上）第2段）。但是，正如我們所知，Fourway沒有提出例外。審判沒有任何異議。在這種情況下，調查是否適當和有時間地採取例外行動是否會取得成功是徒勞的。正如我所看到的，問題在於，儘管原子能機構的訴狀中沒有必要的指控，但Fourway有足夠的機會產生它將依賴的事實，以確定與其有利的不法性有關的政策考慮。相反地​​說，問題是Fourway是否表現出偏見，因為如果原子能機構對純粹的經濟損失的要求得到了適當的懇求，那麼它將會以實質上的不同的方式進行訴訟。 （見egShill v Milner1937 AD 101 at 105; Robinson v Randfontein Estates GM Co Ltd1925 AD 173 at 198; Collen v Rietfontein Engineering Works1948（1）SA 413（A）at 433; Stead v Conradie1995（2）SA 111（A）at 122A-H。）

[15]
正如我所看到的，Fourway的建議，即不法性問題由原審法庭提交決定，因此取決於兩項不連續的查詢結果。首先，根據現實事實，這個法院可以決定，作為政策問題，Fourway應該對原子能機構的索賠損失負責嗎？如果沒有，那將是事情的結局。原子能機構未能提出案件。另一方面，作出決定，根據現有事實確定的不法行為問題，將得到原子能機構的決定，將導致下一次調查。問題是：可以說，如果原子能機構適當地懇求不法性問題，四通會不會有不同的做法呢？如果沒有，原子能機構有權成功。因此，只是發現Fourway有潛在的偏見可以證明轉介給初審法庭是合理的。

Decision

[36]
For these reasons the appeal is dismissed with costs, including the costs of two counsel.

[36]
由於這些原因，上訴被駁回了費用，包括兩名律師的費用。
